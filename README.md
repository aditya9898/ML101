>To get started:




[1.Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

__Choose Python 3.7 version__


[2.Installing Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

__Choose CPU or GPU install depending on your system__

**P.S GPU config is kinda difficult,but fun**

[3.Installing Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)



__You have the following choices for installing the frameworks__

1. Install in different conda environments

1. Install as docker images


[Help for setting up conda envs](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)


[Help for NVIDIA docker images ](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html)

* Go for the docker method ONLY if you're on a Linux System with docker-ce or docker engine installed.
* It would be easier and better to get the environment setup using NVIDIA GPU CLOUD
